# Deadlands-Hand-Probability

This is a project to empirically (Because the probability of hands these complex is hard) calculate the probabilities of each hand showing up based on a wide variety of factors from hand size, to jokers as wild cards. It's based off of the GURPs 4e port of the Deadland's setting (http://www.mygurps.com/Weird_West_4e.pdf). It's also mostly just an excuse to do something fun with python in order to learn more about classes and whatnot.
