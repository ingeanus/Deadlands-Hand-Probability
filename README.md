# Deadlands-Hand-Probability

This is a project to experimentally (Because the probability of hands these complex is hard) calculate the probabilities of each hand showing up based on a wide variety of factors from hand size, to jokers as wild cards. It's based off of the GURPs 4e port of the Deadland's setting (http://www.mygurps.com/Weird_West_4e.pdf). It's also mostly just an excuse to do something fun with python in order to learn more about classes and whatnot.

If you ever care to run this for some reason, you can ignore all the Visual Studio project files. The two .py scripts are all that are necessary. It's a bit of a brute force method (Although there are definitely some optimizations to the logic), but it should function perfectly for any reasonable size hand in the game.
